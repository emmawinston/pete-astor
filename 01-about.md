Pete Astor writes, sings songs and teaches music. 

He was singer songwriter in early Creation Records trailblazers The Loft, releasing two singles, Why Does the Rain and Up the Hill and Down the Slope that helped define the sound of the label and the emerging Indie genre. He subsequently formed The Weather Prophets, releasing *Mayflower* on Creation offshoot Elevation, through WEA. This brief sojourn on a major label was followed by a return to his independent roots, releasing further Weather Prophets records on Creation and launching a solo career with the albums *Submarine* and *Zoo* in the early 1990s. Continuing to perform extensively in France and mainland Europe, his next two solo albums, *Paradise* and *God and Other Stories* were on the Danceteria label, finding new audiences for his music and songs.

Following a two year stint as A&R manager at the publishing arm of the Beggars Group, working with acts such as Hefner, Cornershop and Republica, Astor returned to music in the late 1990s with his Ellis Island Sound and Wisdom of Harry projects, both releasing music on 7”, 12” and 10” for a variety of emerging independent labels such as Static Caravan, Wurlitzer Jukebox and Astor’s own label, Faux Lux.  The Wisdom of Harry eventually signed to Matador, releasing three albums: *Stars of Super 8*, a compilation of the early releases, *House of Binary*, and, in 2003, Torch Division. Astor’s collaboration with David Sheppard, Ellis Island Sound, signed with Heavenly Records, also releasing a compilation of their early releases; he continues to write and release records with Ellis Island Sound, most recently the albums *Regions* and *Divisions* on the Village Green label. 

In 2005, Static Caravan Recordings issued *Hal's Eggs*, a solo album featuring radical reworkings of folk standards. At the same time, Cherry Red released compilation albums featuring his earlier work: The Weather Prophets’ *Blues Skies and Freerides* (The Best Of, 1986-1989), and *Injury Time* (Solo 89-93), a selection from his two Creation and Danceteria albums.  The label also issued *Magpie Eyes* (83-85), a collection of The Loft’s Creation recordings and session tracks. The solo album, *Songbox* came out on Second Language in 2011, featuring an extra disc of cover versions of the albums’ songs by Let’s Wrestle, The Raincoats, Darren Hayman, Comet Gain, The Proper Ornaments and Mathew Sawyer, among others.  

2013 saw the publication of Astor’s study of Richard Hell and the Voidoids’ Blank Generation as part of Bloomsbury’s 33 and a Third Series, along with scholarly articles with Keith Negus on songwriting practice for the Cambridge Journal of Popular Music and Ashgate books. Astor is Senior Lecturer at the University of Westminster, and currently working on new material for the Fortuna POP! Label with Veronica Falls/ Proper Ornaments/ Ultimate Painting’s James Hoare. Astor continues to perform, release records and talk about music to anyone who will listen.
