Hi, I’m Pete Astor - songwriter, musician, teacher and writer. 

I’ve made records as part of [The Loft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Loft_(British_band)), [The Weather Prophets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weather_Prophets), [The Wisdom of Harry](http://www.matadorrecords.com/the_wisdom_of_harry) and [Ellis Island Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Island_Sound) on [Creation](http://www.creation-records.com/), Matador, Heavenly and more. I’m Senior Lecturer in Music at the [University of Westminster](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/astor-pete). I write for [academic journals](http://westminster.academia.edu/PeteAstor) and magazines – I wrote a 33 and a 1/3rd for Bloomsbury on Richard Hell and the Voidoids’ [Blank Generation](http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/richard-hell-and-the-voidoids-blank-generation-9781623561222/).

I’ve got a new record out in January. It’s called [Spilt Milk](http://www.butilikeyou.co.uk/#!pete-astor/c1xdd).
