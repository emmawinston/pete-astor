Pete Astor writes, sings songs and teaches music. 

He was singer songwriter in early Creation Records trailblazers The Loft, releasing two singles, *Why Does the Rain* and *Up the Hill and Down the Slope* that helped define the sound of the label and the emerging Indie genre. He subsequently formed The Weather Prophets, releasing *Mayflower* on Creation offshoot Elevation, through WEA. This brief sojourn on a major label was followed by a return to his independent roots, releasing further Weather Prophets records on Creation and launching a solo career with the albums *Submarine* and *Zoo* in the early 1990s. Continuing to perform in France and mainland Europe, his next two solo albums, *Paradise* and *God and Other Stories* were on the Danceteria label, finding new audiences for his music and songs.

Following a two year stint as A&R manager at the publishing arm of the Beggars Group, working with acts such as Hefner, Cornershop and Republica, Astor returned to music in the late 1990s with his Ellis Island Sound and The Wisdom of Harry projects, both releasing music on 7”, 12” and 10” for a variety of emerging independant labels such as Static Caravan, Wurlitzer Jukebox and Astor’s own label, Faux Lux.  The Wisdom of Harry eventually signed to Matador, while Ellis Island Sound, Astor’s collaboration with David Sheppard, signed with Heavenly Records.  

In 2005, Astor released *Hal's Eggs*, a solo album including radical reworkings of folk standards on Static Caravan Recordings. At around the same time, Cherry Red released compilation albums featuring his earlier work: The Weather Prophets’ *Blues Skies and Freerides (The Best Of, 1986-1989)*, and *Injury Time (Solo 89-93)*, a selection of solo work from his two Creation and Danceteria albums. The label also re-issued The Loft’s *Once More Round the Fair*, a collection of their Creation recordings and session tracks. As well as reforming The Loft at this time for a limited number of shows, Astor continued to write, perform and release records with Ellis Island Sound on the Peacefrog label.

The solo album, Songbox came out on Second Language in 2011, featuring an extra disc of cover versions of the albums’ songs by Let’s Wrestle, The Raincoats, Darren Hayman, Comet Gain, The Proper Ornaments and Mathew Sawyer, among others.  

Astor is Senior Lecturer at the University of Westminster, and currently working on new material for the Fortuna POP! label. He continues to perform, release records and talk about music to anyone who will listen.
